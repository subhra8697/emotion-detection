<h1 align="center"> Emotion Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks and OpenCV</h1>

## Overview

This project aims to detect facial emotions in real-time using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented with Keras and integrated with OpenCV for video processing.
Emotion detection is a task in computer vision and deep learning that involves recognizing the emotional state of a person based on their facial expressions. In this project, we leverage CNNs, a class of deep neural networks, to build a model capable of accurately identifying emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc., from facial images.

## Features

- Real-time facial emotion detection using webcam or video stream
- Integration with OpenCV for capturing and processing video frames
- Implementation of a pre-trained CNN model for emotion classification
- Visualization of detected emotions overlaid on faces in the video stream

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV

## Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/subhra8697/emotion-detection.git
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the main script:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
## Usage
1. Dataset link - [ face-expression-recognition-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset)
2. Ensure your webcam is connected to your computer.
3. Run the main.py script.
4. The script will open a window showing the webcam feed with real-time emotion detection overlay.
